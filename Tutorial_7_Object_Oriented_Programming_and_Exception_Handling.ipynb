        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that allows you to model real-world entities using classes and objects. This tutorial focuses on understanding OOP concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and inheritance. Below is a glossary to help you understand key terms used throughout this notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), defining attributes and behaviors.\n",
        "- **Object**: An instance of a class. Objects represent real-world entities.\n",
        "- **Instance**: A specific object created from a particular class.\n",
        "- **Attribute**: A characteristic or property of an object, often represented as a variable.\n",
        "- **Method**: A function defined within a class that describes the behavior of an object.\n",
        "- **Inheritance**: A mechanism by which one class (child class) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class).\n",
        "- **Exception Handling**: A method used to handle errors and exceptions gracefully to maintain normal flow in a program.\n",
        "\n",
