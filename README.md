# Coding One Module Syllabus

# Introduction to Human-Machine Communication & Creative Robotics Coding

## Module Description

This module introduces you to human-machine communication through programming languages, focusing on Python and foundational concepts of C++. You'll explore the differences between understanding and describing the world in biological and computer systems. We will delve into how to approximate reality through machine models, learn programming fundamentals, logical structures, and algorithmic thinking. Progressing to Object-Oriented Programming, you'll implement and experiment with complex algorithms and mathematics essential for controlling electromechanical systems. Additionally, you'll learn how audio, images, and video are represented, processed, and analyzed computationally to build robot systems capable of understanding their environment.
